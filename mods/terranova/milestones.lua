-- This file is here to enable the game-progression system I had in mind. Specifically, sinking specific materials into the milestone terminal
--    will unlock the associated crafting recipes. For example, see below for an example.

--	utils.register_milestone(1, {
--		cost = {"terranova:iron_rod 20", "terranova:iron_plate 15"},
--		name = "Basic Iron Production"
--	})

-- This code snippet will register milestone 1, the first milestone, to have a cost (what you need to sink) and a name (the display title).
